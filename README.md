# Help Desk
A minimal self-hosted help desk for windows environments

This project is developed using Visual Studio Community 2019

This application is my first c# project, it is not intended to be used in production!

Expect security vulnerabilities, badly written code and inefficient functions.

I think of this as my way to learn and test C# code.  :D

This problem requires a SQL Server (express will do)
Create a database and run the two scripts included in the project under the DB folder.
Once the scripts complete, edit the App.config file within each solution and edit the connection string to match your SQL DB

You will also need to edit the database directly and create your first admin account under the users table.
