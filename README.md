# Help Desk
A minimal self-hosted help desk for windows environments

This project is developed using Visual Studio Community 2019

This application is my first c# project, it is not intended to be used in production!

Expect security vulnerabilities, badly written code and inefficient functions.

I think of this as my way to learn and test C# code.  :D
